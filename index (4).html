            <h3>My name is Omar Khaled Fouda and Im from the class 9F, this E-portfolio is presenting some of my achievments for the Year 21/22. This year, I was glad that I found a way I learn from my mistakes and develop more and have a better mindset that can help me move forward and achieve more. Having a positive mindset can play a really important role in helping an individual achieve their dreams and have more targets for the future, a positive mindset helps people believe in themselves in which they dont give up when something bad happens. Talking about this E-portfolio, it's designed using my research and knowledge on HTML and CSS languages, this is also one reason on why I considered computer science in my Year 10 options. I was motivated to increase my knowledge and research on HTML and how I can develop myself. I started this as a hobby and I am currently enjoying it.  </h3>
